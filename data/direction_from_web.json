    "content": " GitLab competes in a large market space, with aCSMestimated at ~$18B in 2024. GitLab has recently surpassed the $150M ARR milestone, with unusually high revenue growth and retention rates. GitLab is uniquely positioned in the market with a vision to offer a single application for the entire DevSecOps lifecycle. GitLab competes across numerous market segments and aims to deliver value in80+ market categories. GitLabâs product vision is uniquely ambitious, as we were the first DevSecOps player to take asingle application approach. From idea to production, GitLab helps teams improve cycle time from weeks to minutes, reduce development process costs, and enable a faster time to market while increasing developer productivity. With software âeating the world,â this is widely viewed as a mission-critical value proposition for customers. We also have a number oftailwindsin the form of cloud adoption, Kubernetes adoption, and DevSecOps tool consolidation, which are helping fuel our rapid growth. Finally, GitLab has an open source community and distribution model, which has exposed the value of GitLab to millions of developers and has sped up the maturation of our product throughmore than 200 monthly improvementsto the GitLab codebase from our users."

    "content": " Tension between Breadth and Depth:Our ambitious single-application product vision means we need to build out feature function value across a very large surface area. With so much to deliver in a single application, it is a big UX challenge to keep the experience simple, consistent, and seamless between DevSecOps phases. Our challenge is to drive the right balance between breadth and depth by retaining aseed then nurtureapproach in new product areas while simultaneously improving existing product areas that generate usage and revenue. Shifting more focus to product depth will allow us to win and retain sophisticated enterprise customers. GitLab.com and Self-Managed:Another challenge we face is the balance between our self-managed and GitLab.com offerings. GitLab's early paying customers were more interested in self-managed, and the majority of our customers use this offering today. As a result, we focused heavily on delivering a great self-managed customer experience. However, as the market shifts toward cloud adoption, we are seeing an increasing demand for our GitLab.com offering. We now need to rapidly meet the same enterprise-grade security, reliability, and performance expectations our paying customers have come to expect from self-managed in our SaaS (.com offering). Wide Customer Profile:We also serve a wide range of customers, from individual contributor developers to large enterprises, across all vertical markets. This range of deployment options and customer sizes makes our business complex and makes it hard to optimize the customer experience for all customer sizes. Over the past few years, we have prioritized enabling our direct sales channel, but in the process have not focused enough on great customer experiences around self-service purchase workflows, onboarding, and cross-stage adoption. Competition:Finally, we have formidable competition from much larger companies, including Microsoft, Atlassian, and Synopsys to name a few. Microsoft is starting to mimic our single application positioning, and while behind us in the journey, have substantial resources to dedicate to competing with GitLab."

    "header": "Product Strategy",
    "content": " Focus on increasing Stages per Organization(SpO):There is a strong correlation between the number of stages customers use and their propensity to upgrade to a paid package. In fact,adding a stage triples conversion!Each product group should be laser-focused on driving adoption and regular usage of their respective stages, as it should lead to higherNet ARR, reduced churn, and higher customer satisfaction. As outlined in thisuser journey, the most important additional stages for customers to adopt are Create to Verify and Verify to Release, as each of these adoption steps open up three additional stages to users. Harness the unique power of a single application:GitLabâs primary point of differentiation is our single application approach. As we continue to drive value in any given stage or category, our first instinct should be to connect that feature or product experience to other parts of the GitLab product. Thesecross-stage connectionswill drive differentiated customer value and will be impossible for point product competitors to imitate. Recognizing this opportunity, we have grown our R&D organization significantly over the past two years, and plan to invest an outsized amount on R&D for the next 2-3 years to extend our lead in executing against the single application product vision. Increase wider-community contributions:To achieve this ambitious vision more quickly, we will leverage our powerful open source community. Each stage should have a clear strategy for tiering the value of the stage. When stages are early in maturity, we will bias toward including as much functionality in our Core open source version as possible, to drive more rapid adoption and greater community contributions, which will help us mature new stages faster. Once stage adoption is achieved, we can then layer on additional value in paid tiers to encourage upgrades. Make our core journey categories complete:We want to ensure the core product usage experience is great, which will lead to more paying customers and improved customer retention. We intend to maintain our market-leading depth in stages with complete categories, which currently are Verify (Continuous Integration) and Create (Source Code Management and Code Review). Beyond that, we will endeavor to rapidly mature our offering to complete in Plan (3rd most used stage), Release (4th most used stage), and Secure (important element of our Ultimate tier). GitLab-hosted first:Most customers don't want to run GitLab themselves (self-managed), so we should build out the offerings where we do it for them (GitLab-hosted). GitLab-hosted includes our SaaS (GitLab.com), any single-tenant offerings, and other GitLab hosted services that self-managed installations can use. Our customer and revenue growth rate for our SaaS offering is faster than our self-managed offering. To meet growing customer demand, our SaaS offering needs to have enterprise-grade security, availability, and performance. We must also ensurefeature parity between self-managed and SaaSand that customers have an easy migration path from self-managed to SaaS. Going forward, all new features should be available on SaaS when they are available on self-managed, if not before. We will also begin offering GitLab-hosted services to self-managed customers to provide additional value that may not be feasible to deliver in a self-managed environment, e.g. automated cloud backups. Finally, we expect to offer different GitLab-hosted deployment options for single tenant customers and specific geographic regions to meet the regulatory, security, and data residency requirements of various customer segments."

Many teams will see themselves contributing to these areas of emphasis directly. The other teams will continue to execute on their mission - that is also important. The themes are to help facilitate cross-team collaboration when invariably teams working on the 1-year themes may need to collaborate with others. Our guidance is: if any team approaches you to prioritize something that is thematic for this year, consider that as a higher priority than you would normally - as it is in service of the broader product-wide goal that we, as a company, have deemed important to accomplish this year.

    "header": "Mitigating low-end disruption",
    "content": " GitLab is not immune to disruption. In some ways, it is a sign of success that GitLab is now at a scale where we have to think about low-end disruption. Arguably, a few years ago, GitLab was a low-end disruptor. Clayton Christensen defineslow-end-disruptionas follows: Low-end disruption refers to businesses that come in at the bottom of the market and serve customers in a way that is \"good enough.\" These are generally the lower profit markets for the incumbent and thus, when these new businesses enter, the incumbents move further \"upstream.\" In other words, they put their focus on where the greater profit margins are. Our perspective is that low-end disruption is an additional and critical sensing mechanism. This is especially true for the DevSecOps market. We look at the following attributes to figure out if a low-end disruption has anything close to potential product-market resonance. This list is an adaptation of theProduct Zeitgeist Fit. Builder Enthusiasm: Are the most talented, hardest working, or most-in-demand people - the engineers, the developers - so intrigued by the approach that they are working on it, excited by it, and trying to make it a thing? If that is the case, then there is a good chance that they will eventually make it happen, moving beyond the fringes to the mainstream. Number of stars, forks, and contributions in the repo are some metrics to look for here. Despite Test: When people are using a product despite the fact that itâs not the best thing out there, or, in some cases, that itâs straight-up terrible, itâs a great sign. It shows that the product has a line into something emotional, not solely functional. Wanted, not just needed. In the early days, these products can often feel misunderstood or controversial. At first blush, the conceit may even raise a few eyebrows. But to the people who have been working on those products, theyâre so clearly elegant, if temporarily imperfect, solutions to big and important problems that they seem almost obvious once they recognize it. Google Trends and posts on Hacker News are some things to monitor here. T-shirt Test: If people with no connection to the company are wearing their t-shirts or putting their stickers on their laptops or wearing their socks, that desire to associate with the idea indicates as much a movement as a product. A reason low-end disruptors are able to enter the market is that the feature-absorption by users is lower than the feature-velocity of the established vendor. To address this we are focused on aworking-by-default configuration principle."
  },
  {
    "header": "Maturity",
    "content": " As we add new categories and stages to GitLab, some areas of the product will be deeper and more mature than others. We publish a\nlist of the categories, what we think their maturity levels are, and our plans to improve on ourcategories page. We strive to be the best product in the market and to be complete. As the market, customer needs, competitive landscape, and technology change, we should expect our maturities to also change, including changing to a lower maturity rating. By embracing afocus on improvementandlow level of shame, we encourage moving a maturity down. This is a strong indicator that we are realists about our product with an eye on achieving the best results for our customers."
