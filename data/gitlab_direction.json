    "content": "GitLab\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10-year product vision is inspired by our mission to make it so that everyone can contribute. Today GitLab is the DevSecOps Platform, empowering organizations to maximize the overall return on software development by delivering software faster and efficiently, while strengthening security and compliance. We believe our DevSecOps platform vision is shared by market analysts who have coined it the Value Stream Delivery Platform market. Over the next ten years, our vision is to expand GitLab in the following ways. First, we expect to continue rapidly maturing our DevSecOps platform so that GitLab is able to replace any DevSecOps point solution. To replace any DevSecOps solution will require most of our categories to be complete, which is likely a 10 year journey. To ensure rapid progress, we have a 3-year goal to have 50% of our categories at complete maturity by the end of 2023, and this three year product strategy articulates our current focus. Once we achieve that goal, there will still be more work to do, but having half our categories complete will mean most DevSecOps tools are replaceable by GitLab. Second, we expect GitLab to expand its DevSecOps platform to provide similar support for ModelOps and DataOps. Over time, data and machine learning/AI models will increasingly power software experiences. Our customers will need an ability to manage data and its associated ML/AI models in a similar fashion to software projects. We endeavor to support data scientists and data engineers just as we support software developers today, by enabling rapid development, testing, production deployment, and monitoring of data models. We would also expect to automate handling of product usage data collection, GDPR compliance of data under management, cookie and privacy management, experimentation tools, A/B testing, etc. Third, we expect GitLab to become a creation platform for all digital content. This will require us to expand beyond traditional software development. Possible new digital content creation formats we could support include low code/no code development, design creation, and other creative media like music and movies. It would also likely require enhanced content management to better enable customers to create great digital experiences for their users. We execute on our vision rapidly and efficiently by leveraging the best practices of 100,000 organizations co-developing the DevSecOps platform of their dreams. We take a\nseed then nurture approach to maturing our product surface area over time, all the while,\nfocusing on customer results. We leverage sensing mechanisms and product usage data to make decisions about where to increase or decrease investment. You can read more about the principles that guide our prioritization and product thinking in\nour product handbook."

GitLab competes across numerous market segments and aims to deliver value in 80+ market categories. GitLab\u00e2\u0080\u0099s product vision is uniquely ambitious, as we were the first DevSecOps player to take a single application approach. From idea to production, GitLab helps teams improve cycle time from weeks to minutes, reduce development process costs, and enable a faster time to market while increasing developer productivity. With software \u00e2\u0080\u009ceating the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d this is widely viewed as a mission-critical value proposition for customers. We also have a number of tailwinds in the form of cloud adoption, Kubernetes adoption, and DevSecOps tool consolidation, which are helping fuel our rapid growth. Finally, GitLab has an open source community and distribution model, which has exposed the value of GitLab to millions of developers and has sped up the maturation of our product through more than 200 monthly improvements to the GitLab codebase from our users."

We will focus on adding depth to the key areas that make GitLab\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DevSecOps platform unique.

Direction for each stage and category can be found at the respective direction pages. We are not asking the teams to deviate from their core mission. Many teams will see themselves contributing to these areas of emphasis directly. The other teams will continue to execute on their mission - that is also important. The themes are to help facilitate cross-team collaboration when invariably teams working on the 1-year themes may need to collaborate with others. Our guidance is: if any team approaches you to prioritize something that is thematic for this year, consider that as a higher priority than you would normally - as it is in service of the broader product-wide goal that we, as a company, have deemed important to accomplish this year. See Product Investment (internal handbook page) for how we allocate our R&D investment across our product hierarchy."

But there are a lot of other roles involved with the development and delivery of software. That is the ultimate GitLab goal - where everyone involved with software development and delivery uses a single application so they are on the same page with the rest of their team. We are rapidly expanding our user experience for Designers, Compliance Managers, Product Managers, and Release Managers. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also be expanding to the business side, with Executive visibility and reporting.

    "header": "Mitigating low-end disruption",
    "content": "GitLab is not immune to disruption. In some ways, it is a sign of success that GitLab is now at a scale where we have to think about low-end disruption. Arguably, a few years ago, GitLab was a low-end disruptor. Clayton Christensen defines low-end-disruption as follows: Low-end disruption refers to businesses that come in at the bottom of the market and serve customers in a way that is \"good enough.\" These are generally the lower profit markets for the incumbent and thus, when these new businesses enter, the incumbents move further \"upstream.\" In other words, they put their focus on where the greater profit margins are. Our perspective is that low-end disruption is an additional and critical sensing mechanism. This is especially true for the DevSecOps market. We look at the following attributes to figure out if a low-end disruption has anything close to potential product-market resonance. This list is an adaptation of the Product Zeitgeist Fit. A reason low-end disruptors are able to enter the market is that the feature-absorption by users is lower than the feature-velocity of the established vendor. To address this we are focused on a working-by-default configuration principle."

We publish a\nlist of the categories, what we think their maturity levels are, and our plans to improve on our categories page. We strive to be the best product in the market and to be complete. As the market, customer needs, competitive landscape, and technology change, we should expect our maturities to also change, including changing to a lower maturity rating. By embracing a focus on improvement and low level of shame, we encourage moving a maturity down. This is a strong indicator that we are realists about our product with an eye on achieving the best results for our customers."

And where needed, we also allow you\nto monitor clusters and link them to application environments. But we intend to\nuse vanilla Kubernetes, instead of something specific to GitLab. Also outside our scope are products that are not specific to developing,\nsecuring, or operating applications and digital products. In scope are things that are not mainly for SaaS applications: We expect GitLab to continue to grow, and we have several ideas for possible future stages"
